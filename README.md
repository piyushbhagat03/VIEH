# Universal Web Scraper
- Import the necessary libraries: First, you need to import the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries in your Python script. The requests library will be used to send HTTP requests to the website you want to scrape, while beautifulsoup4 will be used to extract data from the HTML or XML markup of the website.

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

```
